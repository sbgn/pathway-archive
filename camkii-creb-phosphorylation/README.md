Pathway of the month is an effort by the SBGN community to reach out to bioscience researchers. It is a redraw of a pathway diagram from a recent research article in SBGN format. It has to be pointed out that the SBGN redraw does not always match exactly to the original diagram. Since SBGN requires more concise and unambiguous representation of the knowledge, some modification is required based on the interpretation of the article by the SBGN curator.

This month's pathway is from the following paper published in the October, 2014 issue of the Cell magazine (PubMed ID: [25303525](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25303525)).

*Ma H, Groth RD, Cohen SM, Emery JF, Li B, Hoedt E, Zhang G, Neubert TA, Tsien RW. (2014) γCaMKII shuttles Ca²⁺/CaM to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression. [Cell 159,281-294](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414011684).*

**SBGN-PD** and **AF** maps were created based on [Graphical Abstract](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414011684#fx1) of the paper. [SBGN-ED](http://www.sbgn-ed.org/), an SBGN editing software, was used to draw the diagram.

Below is the SBGN-PD map of the pathway.

Summary of the diagram
----------------------

Activity-dependent CREB phosphorylation and gene expression are critical for long-term neuronal plasticity. Local signaling at CaV1 channels triggers these events, but how information is relayed onward to the nucleus remains unclear. Here, we report a mechanism that mediates long-distance communication within cells: a shuttle that transports Ca(2+)/calmodulin from the surface membrane to the nucleus. We show that the shuttle protein is γCaMKII, its phosphorylation at Thr287 by βCaMKII protects the Ca(2+)/CaM signal, and CaN triggers its nuclear translocation. Both βCaMKII and CaN act in close proximity to CaV1 channels, supporting their dominance, whereas γCaMKII operates as a carrier, not as a kinase. Upon arrival within the nucleus, Ca(2+)/CaM activates CaMKK and its substrate CaMKIV, the CREB kinase. This mechanism resolves long-standing puzzles about CaM/CaMK-dependent signaling to the nucleus. The significance of the mechanism is emphasized by dysregulation of CaV1, γCaMKII, βCaMKII, and CaN in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders.
