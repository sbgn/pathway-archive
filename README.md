Pathways in this archive are an effort by the SBGN community to reach out to bioscience researchers. It is a redraw of a pathway diagram from a research article in SBGN format. It has to be pointed out that the SBGN redraw does not always match exactly to the original diagram. Since SBGN requires more concise and unambiguous representation of the knowledge, some modification is required based on the interpretation of the article by the SBGN curator.
